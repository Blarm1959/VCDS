# PSTP Project Rules

These rules apply to all projects managed using PowerShellTools / PSTP.

## Change Packages

Change packages created during ChatGPT development work must be named:

`<Project>-Changes-v<version>.zip`

Examples:

`EnergyWatch-Changes-v0.3.1.zip`
`Lipfty-Changes-v9.0.1.zip`
`Quarto-Changes-v0.4.0.zip`

The version in the filename is the intended PSTP release version. The Change Package itself must not directly update PSTP-managed version files; PSTP performs those updates during `Release -Zip`.

## Package Contents

A change package should contain only files that have actually been changed for that development step.

Do not normally include files managed by the PSTP release system, including:

- `release.json`
- `build-info.json`
- `package-lock.json`
- release-history changes in `README.md`

Include one of these only when the development change specifically requires that file to be changed.

## Version Numbers

ChatGPT-created change packages must not increment or alter the project release version.

Versioning is owned by PSTP / ProjectRelease and is performed locally after the change package has been reviewed and applied.

## Project Locations

Projects may be stored on different drives on different computers.

For example, a project may be under:

`C:\bxd\...`

or:

`D:\bxd\...`

Project scripts must not assume a fixed drive letter.

Where possible, a project script should determine its own Git repository root dynamically.

## Trace, Debug and Run Output

PSTP itself does not move project trace, debug, diagnostic, test, simulation, or other temporary run-output files.

This is the responsibility of each individual project's own run workflow.

Before starting a new project run or generation, that project should move its known output files from the previous run into:

`<ProjectRoot>\Old`

Only files explicitly known by that project to be temporary/run output should be moved.

Do not move files merely because their filenames contain words such as:

- `trace`
- `debug`
- `diagnostic`
- `log`

Those names may also belong to genuine project source files.

Historical files placed in `Old` should be retained unless specifically requested otherwise.

If a filename already exists in `Old`, preserve the existing historical file rather than silently overwriting it.

## Project Run Scripts

Project run scripts should determine the repository root dynamically rather than hard-coding paths such as `C:\bxd` or `D:\bxd`.

The normal PowerShell approach is:

`git rev-parse --show-toplevel`

Each project should maintain its own explicit list of files or folders that are outputs from a run and should be archived to `Old` before the next run.

## App Repositories (public web apps from private source)

A project can publish its runnable app to a separate public repository named `<Repo>-App` (for example `Lipfty` -> `Lipfty-App`) while its source repository stays private.

- Publication is automatic: after every successful versioned `Release` (not `-NoBump`, not `-DryRun`), ProjectRelease checks for `<Repo>-App` next to the project folder, or on the same GitHub owner. If neither exists, nothing happens.
- If the App repository exists on GitHub but not locally, it is cloned next to the project folder automatically.
- The App repository mirrors the project's tracked files, excluding `tools/`, `docs/`, `test(s)/`, `Old/`, `.github/`, `.vs/`, `.vscode/`, `node_modules/`, `*.ps1`, `*.psm1`, `*.psd1`, `*.md`, `.git*` files, `package-lock.json` and `LICENSE`. Files removed from the app are removed from the App repository.
- The App repository's own `README.md`, `LICENSE`, `CNAME`, `.nojekyll`, `.gitignore`, `.gitattributes` and `.github/` are never touched. `.nojekyll` is created if missing.
- Each publication is committed as `Publish <Project> v<version>`, tagged `v<version>` and pushed. GitHub Pages on the App repository then serves the app.
- A failed App publication is reported as a warning only; the main release has already been pushed. The next release republishes in full.
- Optional per-project overrides in `release.json`:

```json
"app": {
  "include": [ "tools/runtime-helper.js" ],
  "exclude": [ "js/debug-*.js" ]
}
```

## Source of Truth

These rules are the permanent development conventions for projects using PowerShellTools.

If instructions in a ChatGPT conversation conflict with this file, follow this file unless the user explicitly changes the rule.
